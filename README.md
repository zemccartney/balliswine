## Maintenance

### Convert HEIC image to PNG

On a Mac; given taking pictures on my phone, then airdropping to laptop, and
Apple stores images as HEIC for some reason.

1. Right click file
2. "Quick Actions" > "Convert Image"
3. In the resulting dialog, select "PNG" as format, leave other options as-is
   ("Actual Size" for size, "Preserve Metadata" checked)
4. Submit; new png version of file lands in same folder as HEIC file
