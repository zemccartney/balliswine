First thing's first: what type of wine is it? Or, and I think I'm using this word right (having just learned it this week, I might be showing my inexperience), 
what is the wine's <a href="https://enofylzwineblog.com/2012/08/03/wine-words-demystified-cepage/" target="_blank">c√©page</a>, or grape variety? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mB9CK-r58E" target="_blank">Garnacha</a>! (Also known, perhaps more commonly, by its French name, Grenache. The wine being from Spain, we'll go 
with the Spanish word, of course).

<a href="https://www.wsetglobal.com/knowledge-centre/blog/2021/september/14/understanding-grapes-spotlight-on-grenache/" target="_blank">From some scant reading</a>, garnacha tends to produce sweeter, intensely fruity wines and can handle hot,
dry conditions well."El Marciano" (The Martian) was no exception. Coming from vineyards in the Sierra de Gredos mountain range, this wine was
densely juicy and sweet, though still mellow, not so strong that you felt obliged to sip. <a href="https://alfredomaestro.com/producto/el-marciano/" target="_blank">The winemaker's page (translated)</a> said it perfectly:
"An informal wine ideal for a barbecue with friends" _Informal_. Exactly.

The Sierra de Gredos looks <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attraction_Review-g642219-d1770217-Reviews-Parque_Regional_de_la_Sierra_de_Gredos-Navarredonda_de_Gredos_Province_of_Avila_C.html" target="_blank">absolutely stunning</a>.
A vacation to wander in the mountains and sample more wines like this would be pretty special. Not to mention that, apparently, the name and
label allude to reported <a href="https://terroirizer.wine/products/alfredo-maestro-el-marciano" target="_blank">UFO</a> <a href="https://latitude51.ie/2021/05/17/a-taste-of-sierra-de-gredos-madrid/" target="_blank">sightings</a> in the area.
