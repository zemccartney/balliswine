The wine was very good. Not exceptional, but very good.
Fruity, sweet, but not cloyingly so. Mellow. Not as complex and interesting as the <a href="https://www.maineandloire.com/france-languedocroussillon/p/domaine-balansa-la-vinhota-rouge-2020" target="_blank">La Vinhota</a> from <a href="/2024-10-22">last session</a>. 
Your favorite pop song of a wine. If the La Vinhota is "Watching You Without Me" by Kate Bush, then this wine is "Gibraltar" by Beirut. The
latter enjoyable, uplifting, straightforward, good for just about any mood, not
too low, but not too high, either. The former, weirder, a more textured sensory
experience. Might not be the right fit all the time, but it burrows deeper in your brain.

To be less of an asshole about it, this would be a solid and more than safe choice to bring to a dinner party, one I imagine people would be hard pressed to quibble over.
