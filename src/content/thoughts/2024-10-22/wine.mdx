Purchased from the lovely folks over at <a href="https://www.maineandloire.com" target="_blank">Maine and Loire</a>, here in Portland, ME. Pop in if you’re ever in town, just an exceptional spot to get a good bottle. They described it as floral, honey-esque, almost, sweet, but not saccharine (I’m paraphrasing, putting words in their mouth; ask them for something better). They suggested serving cold, but not chilled, as cold as your tap water.

I really enjoyed this. Felt like a perfect fit for the season. Neither light and vibrantly fruity, like something fit for midsummer, nor spiced and full bodied like a red built for the depths of winter. But right in between. Tart, vaguely sweet, adjacent to honey, yes, like the mellowed out ghost of a mead. Perfect for the occasion.
