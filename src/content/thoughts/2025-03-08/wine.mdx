Puckering! So acidic, sour, but really, really enjoyable. Incredibly light. Zaps your tongue so hard that it feels big and bold,
but then lightens, dissipating faster than it came. Almost tricks you into thinking it's effervescent. But still, a distinctly
fruity taste behind the initial hit of sour, syrupy almost, but hollowed out, enough of a hint that you'd say it's sweet, without
tasting so. Not tannic at all, barely any residual mouth feel. I know this sounds demeaning, I don't mean it to be, I was trying to
place the fruit it most reminded me of, and what crossed my mind: a sour blue raspberry jolly rancher. Which isn't a thing, the
sour part at least, to my knowledge, but like if you popped a blue raspberry jolly rancher, the sweetest of the flavors by my recollection,
in your mouth, swished it around, then sucked on a lemon, you'd get the first taste of this wine. To be clear, I absolutely LOVE blue
raspberry jolly ranchers. Not that I've had one in over decade at least (which, now that I've reminded myself of that fact and having a hopeless sweet
tooth and lack of self-control, I'll inevitably change it), but I have fond memories as a kid, of getting them as a treat at the end
of middle school band class from Mr. K if we behaved. I can see this being lovely in the middle of summer; served cold, alongside a
tall glass (or by my preference, a large mason jar) of ice water.

<a href="https://primalwine.com/products/le-temps-des-cerises-avanti-popolo"  target="_blank">This seller</a> described it as a vin de soif,
which taught me the phrase vin de soif, or drinking wine. Though more usefully, poetically, this definition:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote cite="https://www.lemonde.fr/en/food/article/2024/06/24/what-is-a-vin-de-soif_6675580_119.html">
        To say that it's a wine that quenches thirst like water is not enough. "It's a bottle that can be opened with one other person
        and that you're sure to finish within the evening!" For Morgan Hubert, wine purchasing manager at E.Leclerc, a major French retailer, the definition is obvious.

Lastly, an ... _interesting_ anecdote about the maker, Axel Prufer, and his domaine:

<figure class="quote">
    <blockquote cite="https://livingwines.com.au/wines/le-temps-des-cerises-axel-prufer/">
        Because the forests are the natural habitat of wild boars, Prufer collects human hair from the hairdressers in the local village
        and spreads it around the boundary of his vineyard. He says that the boar pick up the human scent from the hair and avoid the vineyard.
        The vineyard is a picture of health with spiderwebs everywhere and an amazing biodiversity on display.

Ingenious, if not a little to a lot creepy if you stumbled on that without knowing what was up.
