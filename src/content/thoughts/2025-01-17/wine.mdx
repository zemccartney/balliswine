An exquisite, multi-dimensional wine. A biting start, fermented almost, then mellowing
to the point of almost disappearing before closing with a rush of sweetness. Like their 
La Vinhota, <a href="/2024-10-22" target="_blank">tried back on 10/22/2024</a>, a funky, playful drink. I wouldn't mind trying more
from Domaine Balansa; the two bottles I've had from them were unlike just about anything 
else I've tried in my very limited wine-travels.
