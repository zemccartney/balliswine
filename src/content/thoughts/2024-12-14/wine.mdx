Ploughed from the earth, as the folks at Maine and Loire said. It wasn't viscous, of course, 
but it felt heavier, fuller in the mouth than most other wines. On first sip, it almost didn't taste like 
anything for a split second, just a deepness, for lack of a better phrase. Very enjoyable. 
Mild, but in the most interesting way. A wine for late on a quiet winter night.
