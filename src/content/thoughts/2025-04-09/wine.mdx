An interesting one. The entire thing, fleeting. Smelled of tart blackberry, plum.
The taste, sour, slightly acidic, not really sweet at all, tannic.
But then, an aftertaste of cured olive, unctuous, briny, but pleasant, still, not at all overpowering.

But the highlight of this wine was when paired with food.
That night, I had a meal of couscous with preserved lemon and feta and caramelized red onion, halibut, and fris√©e with pickled red onion, bit of a special occasion.
The wine tied it all together; juicy in contrast against the food, lovely, cleansing, olive aftertaste totally gone, mellowed into the food.

A utilitarian wine, for lack of a better phrase.
Not spectacular in its own right, but the perfect wine for a meal, for conversation, for drinking on the side of something, complements and highlights, but not a star in its own right.
A good lesson for wine-tasting, to envision the context of its drinking, where it might taste out of place, where it might show its full character.
