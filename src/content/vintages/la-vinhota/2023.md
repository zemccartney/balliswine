Visually remarkable, smelled lovely. Ruby-tinted, smells of cranberry, sour, pungent, with a mildly sweet undercurrent, like cherry pie, the sour of the cherries and the sweetness of the syrup. Smelled fresh, too, reminiscent of mossy rocks, floral, relaxing deepness of a running brook on a summer morning.

But the wine itself, a disappointment. I loved the 2022; this was markedly different. Far sweeter than I remember, syrupy, more body, lower tannin, lingering, gripping sweetness, like watermelon candy. I wanted it to be tarter, drier, more complicated, like the 2022, which, granted, one of the best wines I recall trying. It did mellow out after decanting for a while, maybe too young, still? I don't know if that's actually a thing, showing my ignorance, wishful thinking. If you like a sweeter wine, you'll love this, because there were some interesting notes to it; and a self-reminder, to try to not weigh down a new wine with comparisons to and expectations from past ones; but still, not my taste.
