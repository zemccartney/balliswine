Exceptional. Wholly different from really every wine I've ever tried. Like a
soda masquerading as a wine. I don't have the biggest sweet tooth, — though I do
love a vanilla Coke from time to time — even less so for wines than say coffee
or food or other drinks, usually, so I appreciate soda-wine may sound
off-putting. But it was like the best of both, mellowing each other out into
this bizarre, but utterly delicious concoction.

Right off the bat, the color: borderline rootbeer-y. I had to hold my glass at
an angle under a light to see any sort of red tint. Smelled like sweet grape,
like chilled grape juice, like hay, sweet grass, citrus peel, alive, tingling.

Drinking, it was so mellow, not dry, not acidic at all, like a mellowed out
ginger ale, with the bubbles pleasantly tingly still but not loudly carbonated.
Vague fig-netwony-ness sits across the tongue if you let it sit in your mouth
and foam and expand before swallowing. I thought of, as a kid, my dad taking us
on a walk through the woods and showing us a sassafras plant, showing us how to
scratch the bark and how it smelled like root beer. This not-quite-sweet,
not-quite-spiced, not-quite-anything cola-esque. So good.
