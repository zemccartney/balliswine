An exquisite, multi-dimensional wine. A biting start, fermented almost, then
mellowing to the point of almost disappearing before closing with a rush of
sweetness. Like their La Vinhota, [tried back on 10/22/2024](/2024-10-22), a
funky, playful drink. I wouldn't mind trying more from Domaine Balansa; the two
bottles I've had from them were unlike just about anything else I've tried in my
very limited wine-travels.
