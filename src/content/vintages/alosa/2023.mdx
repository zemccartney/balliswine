An interesting one. The entire thing, fleeting. Smelled of tart blackberry,
plum. The taste, sour, slightly acidic, not really sweet at all, tannic. But
then, an aftertaste of cured olive, unctuous, briny, but pleasant, still, not at
all overpowering.

But the highlight was pairing with food. That night, I had couscous with
preserved lemon and feta and caramelized red onion, halibut, and fris√©e with
pickled red onion, bit of a special occasion. The wine tied it all together;
juicy in contrast against the food, lovely, cleansing, olive aftertaste totally
gone, mellowed into the food.

A utilitarian wine, for lack of a better phrase. Not spectacular in its own
right, but the perfect wine for a meal, for conversation, for drinking on the
side of something, complementing and highlighting, but not a star in its own
right. A good lesson for wine-tasting, overall. maybe? To envision the context
of its drinking, where it might taste out of place, where it might show its full
character.
