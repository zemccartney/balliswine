Ploughed from the earth, as the folks at Maine and Loire said. It wasn't
viscous, of course, but it felt heavier, fuller in the mouth than most other
wines. On first sip, it almost didn't taste like anything for a split second,
just a deepness, for lack of a better phrase. Very enjoyable. Mild, but in the
most interesting way. A wine for late on a quiet winter night.
