Gentle smell, waft of wood and new office furniture, like walking around a Staples (I smell I hold a nostalgia for, not unlike Blockbuster... showing my age), ending with a floral note, faded white rose. Smell that reminded me of a gently sunny morning. Fresh apple, apple juice, vaguely of orange and grapefruit peel. And the taste comparable, so light, bland almost, no idea what to make of it. Flat, no acidity, only bite from the alcohol, tingling. Bitter and minerally, like from Topo Chico or tonic water. Sweetness amongst bitterness, swirling, layers of the same apple smell throughout.

Not remarkable, but very pleasant, all the same.
