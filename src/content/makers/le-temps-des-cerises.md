An, uh, _interesting_ anecdote about the maker, Axel Prufer:

    Because the forests are the natural habitat of wild boars, Prufer collects
    human hair from the hairdressers in the local village and spreads it around
    the boundary of his vineyard. He says that the boar pick up the human scent
    from the hair and avoid the vineyard. The vineyard is a picture of health
    with spiderwebs everywhere and an amazing biodiversity on display.
