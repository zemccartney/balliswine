## Why Tonight?

I do not care about the NBA Cup, no matter how many times Michael Imperioli says
I should. <span class="font-emoji">ðŸ˜†</span> sorry, about this, I'm a hater

Rockets-Clippers tops the bill for me: I adore the Rockets, frankenstein that
they are. They have too many players, I don't always understand what they're
trying to do with their rotations, but the talent is undeniable. Jalen Green,
Alperen Sengun, Tari Eason, Amen Thompson, Jabari Smith Jr., woof. They're going
to be absolute hell to deal with in 2 years. For LA's part, I've really enjoyed
the Normal Powell experience so far, he's been lights out. And it's been
fascinating watching Harden evolve his game as he's aged; I know there's a lot
of noise around him, but he is such a purely skilled offensive player. With how
the Clippers have competed on defense, this could be a disgusting game, with the
Clippers looking to avenge wednesday night, no less. Really looking forward to
it.

Beyond that, a lot to watch for, but top of mind:

- Heat / Pacers is very much a styles-make-fights game; love Jimmy and Bam, as
  much as they've given me heartburn in the playoffs. As did the Pacers last
  year; the Cs swept them, but not without showing the Celtics can struggle with
  speed (like when the Pacers upended them last week). Early season
  inconsistencies, but I bet this team rounds into a scary form later in the
  year
- Lebron and Wemby on the court together, I can't help it. Oh yea, AD's there,
  too. And Steph Castle, wow does he look like he's going to be really good
- Battle of NY! The Knicks and the Nets have been odd ducks so far. Lots of
  hand-wringing about KAT's defense, Bridges' jumper, Thibs' rotations (always);
  but still so early, just looking for progression, them figuring things out.
  For the Nets, I could say more, but it's Cam Thomas, come on. Letting it fly,
  very fun.
- Pistons-Raptors: Grady Dick's been slinging it lately; record aside, Raps have
  not been a fun matchup for anyone. Detroit hasn't either. Jaden Ivy has been a
  revelation, love Cade and Duren. You're seeing the pieces start to click, very
  cool
- Atlanta-Washington: chaos! Dyson Daniels already stole the ball from you 10
  times. Bilal Coulibaly looks great. This game could easily be a mess, but
  excited to see those two keep rolling.
- Revenge game for the Kings on their home floor. I think the Kings are still
  figuring it out with Demar, which is to be expected. Big change to their
  offense. But I love this team. I hopped right onto the bandwagon a couple
  years back with the light-the-beam run. Results are sometimes down, but the
  entertainment factor never is. Anthony Edwards is also as good a shooter as
  Steph now, so that's cool, I guess
- And of course: how far do the Bulls push the Cavs this time? Cleveland has
  been inevitable. And Chicago has acquitted themselves far better than I think
  anyone expected. Should be a fun one.
