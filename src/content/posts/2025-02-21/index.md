        This All-Star, maybe more than others or maybe just more that I've paid attention to, I've seen complaints of its undoing. That in the weekend's routine, its corporate habits have finally overstepped or outshined its basketball.

        <p>The pressure vacuum of the contest is completely different now than in any other era, to the point where an athlete even stating their intention to compete can come with criticism. The Dunk Contest hasn't made people more opinionated — as the adage goes, everyone has one — but the overlay of our digital reality onto the real thing has made it possible to hear and read all of them.</p>
        <p>And beyond what an added psychic ask this is of contest participants to take on, the fact that there's a digital footprint of every dunk done in recent memory lends to the sense that the Dunk Contest now lacks authenticity and originality. Dunks have always been riffs, variations and finesse on what came before, but when such a brief physical action lives in memory, as something mostly ephemeral, seeing it done live will always be most impactful. When we can pull up almost every past dunk with a couple of key taps, they all start to look the same.</p>

        And you couldn't, if you didn't have, like, ESPN, or you didn't live in Toronto, you weren't able to see the Vince Carter dunks. You just couldn't see them. It wasn't like today, you can watch any clip you want at any moment. If you didn't see it when it happened, you had to have somebody talk to somebody else who then told somebody else who then told somebody else who then told you and that's sort of how you relived it. So that's all going on, you just keep hearing these stories about these double-clutch, reverse, under-the-rim, incredible dunks, and then the NBA announces "Oh, the guy you've been hearing about? The guy you haven't been able to watch? He's going to be here prime time. You're going to watch him and the only thing that matters is the dunks." And everybody lost their fucking mind.

        <p>The TNT guys, like, the tax of being not able to do the thing I love anymore, play basketball at an elite level, those Hall of Famers, champions, is, like, "Now I have to be an asshole because the option is lonely. The option is not being involved in this conversation. The option is not having an applause when I step onto a court when I'm fifty or sixty years old. I will choose to be an asshole if it makes me not lonely"</p>

        <p>And it's really boring to argue that this controversy is part of their appeal, like, creating a discourse like this is why they're sustainable and is good for the league eventually. I don't think it's good for our soul, but it's good for ratings. It's good for chatter. Having Donald Trump in the White House is horrendous, but it's good for media. And I think they do, kind of, profit in a way off of it. But the tax of it is they're ruining the thing I love, which is just like watching these basketball players ball out.</p>

<hr class="!mt-24 !mb-16">

Growing up, my folks took us to a beach resort down in Naples, Florida to visit my grandparents and aunt every February school break, which to this day still lines up with All Star weekend. I wasn't really a basketball fan back then, just generally into sports enough that we'd watch the NBA All Star game every trip, often the night we got in. I don't recall much from those games aside from this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=quxaFedRR7s" target="_blank">Vince Carter dunk</a> and then, bewilderingly, Jason Kapono in a Raptor's uniform in the 3 point contest, which was 2008, apparently. I don't know what that means, that those are my 2 lingering memories.

We must have gone on those trips for close to a decade. I miss them a lot. I'd have to bet that my nostalgia for the game is rooted in it marking a special occasion, traveling, warm weather in the midst of New England winter, seeing family, at a place with cable(!) (which we didn't have till sometime mid-highschool in '05). Why I still love tuning in every year and every year really enjoy myself, even if I inevitably feel bored most of the time because, yes, the game is boring and most of the competitions are shades of boring and the whole thing is, frankly, a mess, even in its "best" years. Why I still enjoyed myself this year, even with the broadcast … choices. I did mention getting bored every year. Oof.

Precipitous is the mood right now. The NBA world at a turning point: Lebron and Steph and KD, markers of a prior generation and still, especially Lebron and Steph, massive ratings draws, nearing the end of their careers. Chatter about the "next face of the league" has ratcheted up, along with the talk of declining ratings and how that's certainly connected to 3 point shooting reaching the limit of viewers' patience. If the NBA keeps paying the tax from Inside the NBA and other high-profile media constantly bashing the direction of the league and players today, if the overarching media take is the game in decline, a faceless league with an unwatchable style, and then people stop watching, and the game has no choice but to decline (I don't see this as a realistic outcome, but then again… declines seem to be slow until their neck-breakingly fast (see: the US government)), then what was really achieved? Some pundits were "right"? And that's fixed basketball and we can all be happy watching again? Pyrrhic victory at an all-time high these days.

There's no imperative to like the league as it is. I'm not arguing that any complaints about the NBA boil down to people taking Shaq or Draymond at their word. Nostalgia's unavoidable: the past is hazy and golden, the present, boring, plodding, still up for debate. But I love the league today and I wish more people would talk about how they do, too. Because no matter the volume of the noise, you can still find those people. There is so much incredible hoops media these days; the folks I quoted above are just a few. People whose work I care about and find comforting in a time when the whole world feels enshittified and the NBA is following suit and is less and less interested in the fan experience. Hence why their words above hit home for me; the throughline that exposure undercuts ceremony and, by extension, nostalgia. Or not just exposure, but that its primary strategy is fomenting conflict, pitting teams, players, eras against each other. It seems predictable that every All Star brings so much noise about the game's downfall, a hearkening back to the past, to older, theoretically more competitive generations. Always vaguely, in retelling. Nostalgia for a time when All Star, as Katie Heindl and Shea Serrano tell it, was a special occasion by virtue of the underexposure of the league. It's a weekend predicated not on usual talking points — legacy, playoff potential, "aura" — , but loving the spectacle of basketball. All ceremony, no stakes. There's shit else to talk about but memories of past ones; appreciating the current and the future sell worse than bashing them, so why not enshrine the past? And if nostalgia depends on not just the passing of time, but the ephemerality and blurriness of memory, edges sanded off so you hold onto only the good (again, Jason Kapono in a Raptors jersey… formative?), and the league grows in part by manufacturing league consumption through the lens of current media's nostalgia for their generations of hoop, it stands to wonder, at the risk of even more melodrama here: will anyone feel anything close to that same nostalgia for the current era of the NBA? Or will this era be so on-demand, so replayable, memories so imprinted with constant league put-downs, that all fans growing up today won't have much to feel nostalgia for, the ceremony of it all, gutted? Is selling your boredom, your grief for special occasions passed, really so much more palatable than paying it forward?

That beach resort closed last year. My folks were down in Naples recently for a wedding and swung by to see what had been made of it. The entire complex — frankly, a garish and excessive property in its own right, as fondly as I remember it — had been torn down, replaced with massive luxury apartment buildings.
