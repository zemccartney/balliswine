On if past is prologue, looking back on the Lynx's dynasty years after their
dominant start to the season.

Dominant, but nothing fancy. Not by their historical standards:

<table class="mx-auto">
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th class="px-6 py-2 text-center" scope="col">
        Season
      </th>
      <th class="px-6 py-2 text-center" scope="col">
        Start
      </th>
      <th class="px-6 py-2 text-center" scope="col">
        Result
      </th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr class="border-t-2 border-rose-950">
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">2016</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">13-0</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">28-6 / Lost Finals</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="border-t-2 border-rose-950">
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">2012</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">10-0</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">27-7 / Lost Finals</td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="border-t-2 border-rose-950">
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">2017</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">9-0</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">
        27-7 / {/* prettier-ignore */}
        <span class="font-emoji" aria-label="Won Finals">&#127942;</span>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <tr class="border-t-2 border-rose-950">
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">2025</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">9-0</td>
      <td class="px-6 py-2 text-center">???</td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>

Not that this means anything at all. A four row table of small sets of games, in
wholly different seasons, different people, different eras of the league. But
framing a team's current performance within their history, how it extends or
tarnishes legacy, seems to be the the default mode for discussing any team with
championship history, with dynastic history, especially. When you're the Lakers
or Celtics, you don't just win a championship anymore. The manufactured elegance
of throughlines and destiny amidst the chaos and often pure stupidity of
professional sports.

  Oh yeah, and last thing about history repeating itself, during this stretch of
  the 2010s, Cheryl Reeve got her team to the final. If they won, they won. If
  the next year, they lost, the next year they won. They did that multiple times
  throughout the decade. So just saying, last year they lost.
