// on only one page (different story if a pattern spread across a larger area)

        Idea is to layer intro rendering on top of the base glob loader i.e. any loading / changes,

        known issue: whenever this runs, the intro content is refreshed and browser reloads,
        but not before flashing an error like 
        
        [ERROR] [InvalidContentEntryDataError] posts â†’ 2025-02-21/intro data does not match collection schema.
        [0] vintage: Did not match union.

        saw the same error with a since-deleted version of the watcher that updated only the record whose intro
        had changed instead of refreshing the entire collection, so root doesn't seem to be calling glob()

        Also, keep seeing the following in console on repeated reloads:
        [Shiki] 20 instances have been created. Shiki is supposed to be used as a singleton, consider refactoring your code to cache your highlighter instance; Or call `highlighter.dispose()` to release unused instances.

        Unclear if happens using astro's loaders or a custom-loader-specific issue
